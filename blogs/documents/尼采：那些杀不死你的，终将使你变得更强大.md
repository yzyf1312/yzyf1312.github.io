著名哲学家尼采（Friedrich Nietzsche）有这么一句名言，“What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger.”那些杀不死你的，终将使你更强大。你觉得呢？

**What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger**

**— Does It, Really?**

> How do you feel about this statement? Does it resonate with truth for you, or does it sound cliched and trite? Do you <u>find comfort in</u> those words, or do they <u>do nothing for</u> you?

resonate



除了表示物理上的“产生共鸣，共振”（to make a sound that is produced as a reaction to another sound），也可以指情感上的“产生/引起共鸣，使产生联想”，英文解释为“if something such as an event or a message resonates, it seems important or good to people, or continues to do this”，如：an idea that resonates with many voters 引起许多投票者共鸣的建议。举个 ：

Her experiences <u>resonate powerfully with me</u>, living, as I do, in a similar family situation.

banal /bəˈnɑːl, -ˈnæl/：表示“平庸乏味的，平庸的，陈腐的”，英文解释为“If you describe something as banal, you do not like it because you think it is so ordinary that it is not at all effective or interesting.”举个 ：

Some historians have been dismissive of this argument.

以下是作者在Facebook上收集到的对这一名言看法，部分网友的评论：

Among other comments:

“Disagree. It often makes you weak and angry.”



“Agree, but sometimes what doesn't kill you still really, really hurts.”



“It's true but still, I hate being pushed through hell to see what I'm made of. Can't we all just take our word for it?”



“Story of my life.”



“I think that phrase, like most definitive statements, represents more what we'd like to be true than what necessarily is.”



“God keeps confusing me with a strong woman.”



> The idea that *what doesn't kill you makes you stronger* is based on the theory that by going through difficult experiences, people build up their strength for the next, possibly more painful event that may occur. This can be a comforting thought, especially during a trauma — that all of the pain one may be suffering will be rewarded with a stronger sense of inner courage and the ability to take on the next painful life event.



trauma



trauma /ˈtrɔːmə/表示“（精神上的）创伤；痛苦经历”，英文解释为“Trauma is a very severe shock or very upsetting experience, which may cause psychological damage.”举个 ：

I'd been through the trauma of losing a house.

我已经历过失去房子的痛苦。



> It can be viewed as a badge of honor — a war wound, so to speak — to come out of a really awful time feeling more brave, more powerful and more ready to take on the next battle.



> That's not how it's been for me, though. I have found that after especially hard times I am weak, exposed and sad. If I was supposed to get stronger, then most of the time I was doing something wrong.



A psychiatrist explained it to me this way:



*“Don't believe that crap about what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. What doesn't kill you hurts and makes you vulnerable and leaves you traumatized.”*



psychiatrist



psychiatrist /saɪˈkaɪətrɪst/表示“精神病医生”，英文解释为“A psychiatrist is a doctor who treats people suffering from mental illness.”



crap



表示“瞎话；胡扯”，英文解释为“something someone says that you think is completely wrong or untrue”。





Can I just say it was an enormous relief to hear him say that?



You mean, I don't have to be strong all the time? I can feel unhappy about things that happened in my life and not have to always grow from the most awful experiences? Sometimes, things are just bad?



Yes. Sometimes bad things happen and we don't grow stronger. Sometimes we just feel... bad.



*...but the bulk of psychological research on the topic shows that, as a rule, if you are stronger after hardship, it is probably despite, not because of the hardship. The school of hard knocks does little more than knock you down, hard. What doesn't kill us in fact makes us weaker. - Noam Shpancer, Ph.D., [Psychologytoday.com](Psychologytoday.com)*



the school of hard knocks



表示“逆境，艰苦生活的磨炼”，英文解释为“If you learn something in the school of hard knocks, you learn it as a result of difficult or unpleasant experiences.”



> As I learned from my Facebook friends, many people believe that they have grown stronger through experiencing horrendous, life-altering experiences. I admire them for the strength they've found through adversity. And it's true, some difficult experiences have led me to be a stronger person.



horrendous



表示“骇人的；（程度大得或严重得）极其令人不快的”，英文解释为“Something that is horrendous is very unpleasant or shocking. Some people use horrendous to describe something that is so big or great that they find it extremely unpleasant.”举个 ：

He described it as the most horrendous experience of his life.

他把那件事形容为他生活中最恐怖的经历。



adversity



表示“困境；逆境”，英文解释为“Adversity is a very difficult or unfavourable situation.”举个 ：

He showed courage in adversity.

他在逆境中显示出了勇气。



区分：diversity：表示“多样性”（The diversity of something is the fact that it contains many very different elements.）



> But I have to agree with the doctor in that the really big things, the things that changed my life without my consent, the loss of loved ones, the terrifying experience of having a sick child and not knowing what was wrong, being desperately lonely or panic-stricken with anxiety — there has been nothing empowering about those times. I've felt my heart break and my soul sucked dry, but I haven't felt stronger after the worst days. I've only felt grateful that they were over.



panic-stricken



表示“惊慌失措的，恐慌万分的”，英文解释为“If someone is panic-stricken or is behaving in a panic-stricken way, they are so anxious or afraid that they may act without thinking carefully.”举个 ：

Panic-stricken travellers fled for the borders.

惊慌失措的旅行者们向边界逃跑。



补充：

-stricken表示“受严重侵害的，遭受重创的”（suffering severely from the effects of something unpleasant），还有一些表达如：a leukemia-stricken child. 一个患白血病的孩子，a poverty-stricken area 贫困地区。



> Most of the time, strength doesn't come from life's worst moments — it comes from the best. I feel strong because I've been loved — and am loved — by some amazing people, and because I've loved them back. I find strength in the times when I've been most generous and caring. I find strength in my ability to sometimes deal well with the bad days, to look for help when I need it, to disappear when I have to, and to re-emerge when I'm ready.



> I'm allowed to be sad and unhappy about the things that have hurt me in my life. I don't feel like I'm strong because of them — but I do feel I can be strong in spite of hem.
